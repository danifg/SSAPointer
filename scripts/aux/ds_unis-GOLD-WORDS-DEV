On
an
aside
,
this
type
of
education
is
not
for
the
undisciplined
learner
.

I
can
say
that
studying
in
the
University
of
Phoenix
Online
has
been
a
great
experience
.

The
professor
are
very
experienced
and
I
have
learned
a
lot
.

I
am
two
classes
away
to
finish
my
Master's
Degree
.

Thanks
!

Devry

This
College
was
paid
$2
million
dollars
by
Household
International
,
a
predatory
lender
,
to
add
a
website
that
encourages
debt
among
service
members
,
and
seems
to
disregard
the
Soldiers
and
Sailors
Act
which
provides
temporary
relief
to
active
duty
service
members
.

Household's
parent
HSBC
is
linked
to
a
bank
owned
by
the
former-regime
of
Saddam
Hussein
.

The
bank
relationship
is
being
investigated
for
money
laundering
.

UMUC
seems
to
have
disregarded
this
information
,
took
the
$2
million
,
and
turned
the
other
way
.

It
is
unconscionable
that
UMUC
is
supposed
to
provide
higher
education
to
military
personnel
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
is
in
partnership
with
a
predatory
lender
that
often
mishandles
payments
,
records
,
and
disregards
the
law
.

UMUC
should
be
blacklisted
from
US
installations
and
banned
from
taxayer
contracts
handed
out
by
the
Department
of
Defense
and
the
US
Army
,
until
it
ceases
its
relationship
with
Household
International
.

It
looks
again
like
UMUC
will
do
anything
for
money
,
even
profiteering
off
soldiers
serving
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
.

I
have
just
finished
my
course
work
for
a
PhD
in
Education
.

I
have
two
undergraduate
degrees
and
a
masters
degree
from
traditional
universities
.

I
have
found
the
course
work
and
research
more
challenging
and
of
higher
quality
at
Capella
than
at
any
of
the
other
institutions
I
graduated
from
.

No
institution
is
perfect
,
they
are
run
by
people
,
and
people
are
not
perfect
.

I
reccomend
Capella
to
any
highly
motivated
person
who
wants
educational
and
personal
advancement
.

UOP
makes
the
statement
work
at
your
own
pace
on
your
own
time
.

This
is
the
biggest
joke
.

I
am
in
my
3rd
class
of
Masters
in
Special
Education
.

There
has
been
nothing
but
problems
with
the
Learning
Team
garbage
.

I
do
not
procrastinate
and
want
my
work
done
ASAP
but
when
working
in
these
groups
you
have
to
constantly
leave
messages
for
people
.

I
wrote
the
2nd
and
3rd
paper
myself
and
sent
it
.

Nothing
.

I
was
told
by
a
counselor
that
if
the
people
in
the
TEAM
do
not
contribute
then
you
are
responsible
for
finishing
the
paper
without
the
other
TEAM
members
names
on
it
.

I
did
not
apply
to
UOP
to
do
group
work
ALL
THE
TIME
.

This
is
a
masters
degree
program
and
every
student
should
stand
on
their
own
two
feet
and
get
the
work
done
.

It
is
not
fair
that
some
people
put
in
hours
upon
hours
while
others
slide
.

I
am
tired
of
waiting
for
people
to
submit
work
and
wait
until
the
day
it
is
due
.

All
I
can
say
is
that
if
you
do
not
want
to
do
TEAM
work
and
stay
up
late
just
to
get
papers
done
because
of
other
team
members
then
this
is
not
a
program
for
you
.

Even
if
you
do
the
work
yourself
and
submit
it
you
will
be
docked
points
.

So
technically
you
are
damned
if
you
do
and
damned
if
you
don't
.

I
am
in
the
process
of
looking
into
another
school
that
has
no
TEAM
work
.

You
do
the
work
on
your
own
and
have
16
weeks
to
complete
it
.

If
you
finish
before
the
16
weeks
you
can
move
on
to
the
next
course
.

This
I
believe
at
least
for
me
is
the
best
way
to
go
.

If
I
fail
it
will
because
of
me
,
with
UOP
if
you
fail
it
is
because
of
a
memeber
of
the
TEAM
not
doing
their
work
.

Points
will
be
docked
.

I
am
looking
forward
to
getting
out
of
this
program
.

Very
Disappointed
.

Someone
wants
to
steal
an
identity
and
that
person's
wallet
too
,
they
need
only
go
online
to
UMUC
sites
.

or
in
one
of
the
student
groups
,
or
see
thecomplaintstation.com
for
more
details
.

I
am
now
a
senior
with
St
.
Leo
and
I
don't
have
any
complaints
.

You
never
have
to
be
online
at
any
certain
time
,
the
amount
of
work
for
the
most
part
is
not
overwhelming
,
and
yet
you
learn
.

Because
you
have
to
maintain
self
discipline
it
causes
you
to
learn
more
.

All
tests
are
open
book
so
that
makes
it
easier
.

I
would
strongly
recommend
St
.
Leo

The
equipment
used
in
our
courses
was
often
out-of-date
,
as
was
the
instructor
.

The
course
texts
were
too
basic
,
and
for
intro
level
students
,
I
expected
something
more
challenging
form
the
UMUC
experience
.

There
is
no
student
community
because
UMUC
is
for
career
oriented
people
.

That
means
,
it's
about
taking
course
to
get
a
quick
degree
to
move
up
the
corporate
ladder
,
and
going
home
right
after
class
.

There
isn't
much
emphasis
on
literature
or
art
or
others
soft
subjects
,
so
meeting
people
with
those
interests
is
even
more
difficult
.

It
doesn't
help
that
the
faculty
and
administration
deliberately
spies
on
students
in
student
groups
,
plants
information
in
the
groups
,
and
seeks
to
destroy
the
student
groups
when
the
messges
get
to
negative
about
UMUC
.

That
is
what
UMUC's
general
cousnel
did
to
a
Yahoo!-based
student
group
.

They
are
doing
it
again
to
other
web-based
student
groups
now
.

You
have
to
know
who
to
talk
to
or
where
to
dig
for
that
info
,
but
it's
there
to
be
found
.

I
thought
the
courses
would
be
more
challenging
,
but
because
anyone
can
enroll
in
a
course
,
the
instructors
have
to
dumb
it
down
so
everyone
can
enjoy
.

I
also
don't
like
the
fact
that
UMUC
assigns
instructors
across
multiple
fiel;ds
,
outisde
their
departments
to
teach
courses
.

Anyone
can
teach
anything
at
UMUC
seems
to
be
the
policy
.

It's
a
quick
degree
for
people
who
need
one
to
claw
there
way
to
the
top
of
a
civil
service-type
job
.

Its
not
perfect
,
but
it
works
for
individuals
who
are
motivated
,
hardworking
and
yet
are
busy
with
their
careers
.

The
medium
of
instruction
deserves
some
improvement
,
but
otherwise
,
I
think
it
has
all
the
pros
and
cons
of
any
regular
F2F
university
.

It
has
both
excellent
and
mediocre
professors
.

I
think
,
as
a
student
completing
my
masters
in
Information
Technology
,
it
is
not
a
bad
school
at
all
.

Can't
vouch
for
the
other
streams
though
.

Capella
University
was
a
complete
waste
of
time
and
money
.

Having
attended
real
universities
,
prior
to
paying
a
huge
amount
of
money
to
Capella
,
I
was
appalled
at
the
lack
of
academic
integrity
basically
,
pay
your
money
and
you'll
finish
.

One
of
the
bizarre
things
you'll
notice
about
Capella
and
their
students
is
that
they
refer
to
themselves
as
"
learners
"
-
that
should
be
almost
offensive
to
anyone
who
is
really
concerned
with
the
attainment
of
a
genuinely
rigorous
educational
undertaking
:
a
cat
can
learn
to
use
a
litter
box
,
a
rat
can
learn
to
use
a
Skinner
box
,
a
dog
can
learn
to
drool
when
a
bell
has
been
struck
.

A
student
,
on
the
other
hand
is
one
who
is
actively
engaged
in
the
acquisition
of
new
knowledge
;
a
process
that
never
stops
.

If
you
want
to
be
a
learner
who
merely
connects
the
dots
of
poorly
written
(
and
generic
)
syllabi
created
by
faculty
that
really
aren't
actively
engaged
in
teaching
Capella
is
the
choice
for
you
.

Spend
your
money
and
get
your
piece
of
worthless
paper
.

If
a
CTU
recruiter
contacts
you
.
.
.
RUN
!

Their
Software
Engineering
Program
is
about
$32,000
shy
of
being
a
diploma
mill
.

AND
that
you
will
qualify
for
a
job
as
a
programmer
upon
graduation
.

LIES
!

The
free
books
taht
they
provide
are
so
poor
in
quality
you
cannot
even
find
their
isbn's
on
the
internet
.

It
is
impossible
to
be
successful
at
this
university
or
to
learn
everything
.

But
if
you
want
to
learn
something
.
.
.
stay
away
and
go
someplace
that
provides
students
with
the
tools
necessary
to
get
jobs
when
they
graduate
.

Please
someone
tell
me
how
this
school
received
a
regional
accreditation
!

I
keep
having
to
call
the
IRS
(
which
i've
never
had
to
do
)
to
request
info
from
them
and
then
having
them
say
'well
we've
never
had
a
school
request
something
like
that....'
.

Overall
,
i'm
left
with
having
doubts
of
even
attending
this
school
because
I
haven't
even
started
attending
classes
yet
and
i'm
already
having
this
much
trouble
and
its
causing
so
much
stress
.

Not
to
mention
,
I
talked
to
a
lady
who
works
in
the
financial
aid
dept
.

today
and
she
sounded
b*tchy
.

That
was
just
icing
on
the
cake
.

Thanks
Capella
!
!
!
!

So
,
now
I
will
leave
my
original
comment
about
Capella
.

My
gripe
has
to
do
with
the
initial
contact
I
personally
experienced
at
Capella
University

I
contacted
Capella
because
I
was
interested
in
online
learning
.

The
request
was
to
let
me
speak
to
someone
who
is
currently
in
one
of
their
graduate
programs
.

I
hate
bad
service
.

Other
schools
have
plenty
of
references
that
I
am
able
to
contact
.

I
ultimately
saw
this
as
a
blessing
because
I
am
no
longer
pursuing
this
school
anymore
.

Because
of
my
experience
,
I
feel
it's
important
to
let
others
know
about
it
.

My
initial
experience
with
Capella
wasn't
good
.

This
led
me
to
look
at
what
others
are
saying
and
"
some
"
are
saying
that
the
school
is
lousy
from
their
experiences
also
and
they
are
currently
in
the
program
.

This
did
not
surprise
me
.

Some
of
these
students
are
also
on
there
way
to
PhDs
.

Buyer
Beware-
Look
around
at
the
other
reviews
and
ratings
before
you
invest
your
hard
earned
time
and
money
.

Just
google
Capella
and
ratings
or
reviews
and
then
you
can
make
a
more
informed
decision
before
you
invest
.
.

Besides
,
of
course
I
have
a
Marxist
Perspective
when
it
comes
to
Capella
.

Gee
,
I
wonder
why
that
is
?

You'll
see
for
yourself
whether
it's
worth
your
investment
.

University
of
Phoenix
is
a
complete
waste
of
time
and
money
.

The
online
experience
is
like
no
other
!

They
misrepresent
their
programs
and
then
once
enrolled
,
they
change
midstream
.

I
have
found
that
it
is
easier
to
sit
in
a
live
class
1
night
a
week
oppossed
to
being
online
nearly
every
day
.

Another
HUGE
turnoff
was
the
group
work
.

Instructors
paired
the
class
into
teams
and
assigned
papers
,
projects
and
power
point
presentations
.

Sounds
simple
,
but
when
one
member
of
the
team
does
not
do
their
share...everyone
suffers
!

I
am
all
for
being
a
team
player
,
but
not
when
it
comes
to
my
education
.

I
believe
this
is
something
and
individual
needs
to
achieve
on
their
own
!

STUDENTS
BEWARE
!
!
!
!
!

I
go
the
seattle
campus
and
in
the
CIS
program
and
agree
the
that
school
is
expensive
.

However
,
for
the
courses
that
are
critical
for
my
career
are
hard
core
.

Don't
plan
on
having
a
life
if
you
are
going
to
school
and
having
a
job
.

Do
not
attend
this
school
if
you
havent
already
enrolled
.

UOP
sucks
and
lies
too
.

Have
you
ever
heard
of
electronic
books
?

How
the
hell
do
you
pay
for
electronic
books
?

thats
crazy
!

If
im
paying
for
a
book
,
give
it
to
me
!
or
I
better
have
lifetime
access
to
this
book
online
.

Thats
highway
robbery
.
!
Watch
out
for
lying
enrollment
counselors
,
such
as
Britt
Miller
!

Tells
you
whatever
you
want
to
hear
,
to
get
you
into
the
school
.

Then
allows
you
to
learn
all
the
lies
you
were
told
as
they
unfold
!

I
would
like
to
say
that
University
of
Phoenix
is
one
of
the
best
online
programs
out
there
.

I
work
at
a
hospital
,
and
it
is
hard
to
get
to
a
traditional
classroom
.

I
soon
found
that
almost
half
of
my
wing
got
their
bachelors
from
this
school
.

The
counselors
are
wonderful
,
the
faculty
overall
was
good
,
and
very
flexible
.

What
I
do
not
understand
is
all
the
negative
feedback
.

I
would
bet
that
most
of
the
negative
people
did
not
make
it
through
a
class
or
two
.

The
bottom
line
is
that
school
is
hard
,
and
if
you
are
not
willing
to
do
the
work
,
it
will
be
very
frustrating
.

Own
up
to
your
own
inabilities
,
but
do
not
blame
the
biggest
Univ
.
in
the
country
for
not
being
good
at
what
they
do
.

If
they
are
so
expensive
,
and
not
good
,
why
are
they
the
largest
school
in
the
U.S
.
Word
would
get
out
in
the
past
15
years
they
have
been
doing
it
.

I
would
like
to
encourage
those
that
are
serious
about
their
education
to
look
at
University
of
Phoenix
!
!
!

Capella
University
is
a
joke
.

It's
nothing
more
than
a
diploma
mill
that
provides
a
substandard
education
.

Instructors
ignore
students
and
the
administration
is
simply
incompetent
.

I
am
currently
a
student
at
UoP
,
and
for
every
post
on
here
there
are
some
truth
to
them
.

However
,
that
said
,
I
am
approaching
my
last
year
in
my
BSB/
Marketing
program
.

Name
me
one
team
environment
without
slackers
.

I
work
damn
hard
for
my
grades
and
people
who
are
on
my
team
who
chose
not
to
work
are
shown
the
door
.

I
lay
down
the
law
.

Period
!
!
I
am
not
paying
$1300
for
a
course
to
have
some
semi-literate
,
low
self-esteem
person
affect
my
grade
.

UoP
has
to
clean
up
its
act
and
stop
admitting
everybody
and
their
grand
mama
.

They
have
to
establish
minimum
standards
and
maintain
them
.

I
have
had
classes
with
students
who
are
reading
at
elementary
school
level
and
I
was
so
freaking
embarrassed
.

I
have
had
conversations
with
faculty
who
have
confided
their
frustrations
with
the
quality
of
the
students
.

Certainly
I
have
been
tempted
to
transfer
to
a
cheaper
school
with
better
reputation
,
but
my
bills
got
to
be
paid
plus
I
keep
getting
promotion
after
promotion
because
I
have
applied
the
knowledge
I
have
learned
in
my
current
profession
.

So
to
all
the
nay
sayers..it
is
not
Yale
or
Columbia...it
is
UoP
and
it
has
a
place
.

UoP
is
a
departure
from
tradition
and
people
are
always
scared
of
change
.

I
embrace
change
and
will
use
the
positive
and
change
the
negative
.

Over
to
the
Apollo
to
make
the
next
moves
.

I

Washington

PA

Hi
!

I
responded
to
an
ad
online
as
I'm
interested
in
my
Master's
Degree
.

I
got
called
back
almost
immediately
.

It
was
apparent
that
the
"
Admissions
Advisor
"
was
really
a
salesman
reading
off
of
a
script
.

I
decided
to
check
out
CTU
Online
on
the
internet
.

I
read
some
poor
reviews
of
CTU
Online
,
and
one
that
connected
them
with
"
American
InterContinental
University
"
which
I
confirmed
(
via
multiple
websites
)
is
on
probation
.

I
read
a
very
negative
review
of
AIU
,
which
led
me
to
search
further
.

This
is
from
the
parent
website
:

"
Career
Education
is
an
industry
leader
whose
gold-standard
brands
are
recognized
globally
.

Those
brands
include
,
among
others
,
the
Le
Cordon
Bleu
Schools
North
America
;
the
Harrington
College
of
Design
;
the
Brooks
Institute
of
Photography
;
the
Katharine
Gibbs
Schools
;
American
InterContinental
University
;
Colorado
Technical
University
and
Sanford-Brown
Institutes
and
Colleges
.
"

I
would
avoid
any
of
the
above
institutions
,
based
on
what
I
found
out
.

Note
:
I
haven't
attended
CTU
Online
,
which
is
why
I
gave
them
a
"
2
"
rating
vs
.
a
"
1
"
.

My
rating
is
based
on
my
contact
with
their
employees
and
my
research
online
.

There
are
reviews
from
students
of
CTU
Online
that
like
their
experience
.

Here
is
the
review
of
AIU
:

PS-If
you're
a
student
at
any
of
the
schools
above
,
I'm
not
cutting
you
down
,
and
I
hope
it
goes
well
for
you
.

DeVry
University
is
a
great
investment
.

The
school
is
going
through
some
transistions
as
far
as
their
student
services
is
concerned
.

The
undergraduate
and
graduate
programs
combined
last
year
under
the
name
DeVry
University
.

The
administration
is
diligently
trying
to
combine
the
resources
of
the
school
to
support
both
segments
of
the
student
body
.

I'm
a
graduate
student
at
the
school
and
the
education
I
get
is
extremely
relevent
.

I
can't
overemphasize
that
enough
.

The
school
gives
students
a
knowledge
base
that
makes
them
extremely
competitive
in
the
corporate
world
.

I've
received
valuable
advice
from
many
of
these
real
world
professionals
that
I
know
I
couldn't
get
at
a
traditional
school
.

I
often
have
to
call
multiple
times
to
get
a
request
taken
care
of
.

The
relaxed
admissions
standards
comes
from
the
school
being
a
for-profit
school
.

I'm
sure
all
colleges
have
their
share
of
slackers
so
that
shouldn't
dissuade
anybody
from
attending
the
school
.

If
you
are
interested
in
having
a
marketable
degree
from
a
school
that
is
recognized
across
the
nation
then
DeVry
is
the
place
for
you
.

If
you
absolutely
have
to
have
a
football
team
,
pep
rallies
,
and
all
the
other
mindless
activities
associated
with
college
,
I
suggest
looking
elsewhere
.

In
general
I
have
been
pleased
with
UOP
instruction
and
technical
support
is
excellent
,
but
their
response
times
with
the
newsgroups
are
often
unacceptable
.

UOP
needs
to
put
some
more
money
into
infrastructure
even
if
it
has
to
take
some
away
from
their
huge
advertising
budget
.

Slow
response
times
or
no
connectivity
at
all
are
becoming
much
too
frequent
as
they
push
for
more
students
without
sufficiently
upgrading
infrastructure
.

I'm
not
sure
I
can
continue
recommending
UOP
to
other
students
unless
they
correct
these
issues
.
