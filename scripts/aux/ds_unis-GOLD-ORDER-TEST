Horrible
experience
!

The
learning
groups
mentioned
by
others
are
a
nightmare
if
you
end
up
with
other
members
who
show
up
at
the
00th
hour
asking
what
they
should
do
to
contribute
to
a
project
that's
been
in
the
works
for
0
weeks
.

In
my
view
the
sole
purpose
of
this
institution
is
to
collect
(
exorbitant
)
tuition
.

I
am
a
Ph.D
student
in
the
school
of
education
with
an
emphasis
in
teaching
and
learning
at
Capella
.

I
am
in
my
dissertation
,
having
completed
some
very
extensive
work
in
each
course
(
including
much
effort
in
my
research
papers
for
each
class
and
very
difficult
comps
,
both
written
and
<_UNK>
have
found
the
coursework
,
comps
,
and
colloquia
very
rewarding
and
challenging
.

Anyone
wanting
to
just
sit
through
a
degree
without
having
to
get
involved
can
attend
any
traditional
institution
,
but
with
Capella
and
her
sister
school
Univ
.

of
Phoenix
,
one
has
to
be
involved
in
a
continuous
manner
,
as
every
learner
has
to
complete
the
very
extensive
research
papers
,
to
accomplish
what
face-to-face
traditional
institutions
do
not
do
.

I
have
attend
both
,
and
will
never
attend
a
traditional
institution
again
.

I
have
just
finished
an
Associates
in
Accounting
degree
and
am
currently
in
my
first
class
in
the
Bachelor's
in
Information
Technology
degree
track
.

I
have
to
agree
with
<_UNK>
.

The
people
who
are
whining
about
UoP
being
the
worst
school
ever
are
the
ones
who
didn't
finish
,
which
is
obvious
.

The
ones
who
talk
about
get
swindled
or
hoodwinked
with
FAFSA
and
scholarship
loans
are
probably
the
ones
with
sub-prime
mortgages
that
have
begun
ballooning
and
they're
probably
whining
about
how
they
were
hoodwinked
into
those
as
well
.

It's
always
somebody
<_UNK>
fault
and
they're
not
afraid
to
shout
it
out
to
the
world
.

The
ones
who
complain
about
UoP
costing
so
much
obviously
never
went
to
college
anywhere
before
this
.

<_UNK>
a
clue
folks
,
it's
not
any
cheaper
at
a
university
.

Do
you
think
UoP
is
in
it
for
the
joy
?

It's
a
for-profit
organization
.
.
.

If
you
are
serious
about
going
to
school
and
getting
an
education
,
but
don't
want
to
add
the
extra
commitment
of
being
somewhere
at
a
given
time
to
attend
classes
,
UoP
fits
the
bill
.

I
can
come
home
and
work
in
the
evenings
and
weekends
and
not
have
to
worry
about
being
somewhere
to
attend
class
for
three
hours
at
a
crack
.

The
classes
offer
real
education
and
learning
,
but
to
get
the
most
out
of
them
you
have
to
do
the
work
.

In
the
<_UNK>
classes
I've
taken
so
far
,
no
matter
how
elementary
I
thought
they
were
at
the
beginning
,
I
always
came
away
having
learned
something
new
.

Instructors
vary
in
quality
,
but
most
are
hard-working
and
want
to
help
you
succeed
.

The
ones
that
aren't
get
weeded
out
fairly
quickly
.

UoP
allows
anyone
who
wants
to
pay
them
to
attend
,
so
a
diverse
group
of
people
will
enroll
.

Some
will
be
shocked
by
the
work
they
will
have
to
do
in
class
and
soon
you'll
be
hearing
from
them
in
this
forum
.

<_UNK>
two
or
three
per
class
will
have
the
organization
and
determination
to
do
well
.

Most
every
person
who
does
enroll
will
have
sub-standard
writing
abilities
,
some
because
they
never
learned
,
and
some
because
they
got
lazy
over
the
years
.

The
ones
who
stay
will
sharpen
those
skills
and
become
more
polished
in
their
thinking
and
their
writing
.

Bottom
line
:
It's
not
cheap
,
but
then
you're
paying
for
an
extensive
infrastructure
built
to
deliver
education
to
you
wherever
you
go
.

Don't
expect
to
have
your
hand
held
just
because
you're
paying
money
for
the
class
.

The
purpose
of
school
is
to
learn
,
and
that
has
to
come
from
within
.

Maybe
not
everyone
has
had
a
bad
experience
with
DeVry
but
I
can
give
you
two
examples
of
why
NOT
to
go
there
.

0
.

Mismanaged
financial
aid
.

They
have
this
wonderful
<_UNK>
program
they
try
to
sell
you
the
problem
in
my
experience
is
they
got
it
wrong
.

They
set
it
too
low
and
I
wasn't
aware
of
it
until
I
got
nasty
emails
threatening
probation
.

I
finally
was
able
to
cover
the
difference
with
a
private
loan
and
I
thought
I
was
golden
.

I
have
tried
for
0
weeks
now
to
get
straight
answers
as
to
why
private
funds
were
returned
and
I
have
been
ran
around
the
block
more
times
than
a
runner
at
the
Boston
Marathon
.

Teacher
quality
could
be
vastly
improved
.

My
last
two
classes
were
the
absolute
worst
for
teacher
quality
.

The
other
teacher
was
even
worse
in
fact
any
time
you
contacted
him
<_UNK>
wait
over
a
week
to
hear
back
.

Work
was
graded
very
slowly
in
fact
I
was
doing
the
final
before
the
last
two
weeks
had
been
completed
which
only
hurts
me
,
the
student
,
in
the
end
because
I
can't
review
it
.

The
instructor
also
couldn't
spell
or
write
effectively
which
was
a
major
turn-off
to
his
qualifications
.

I
had
a
programming
class
with
no
lectures
which
is
always
fun
for
beginners
to
try
to
learn
concepts
without
any
sort
of
interactivity
.

With
DeVry
you
get
high
cost
and
not
much
in
return
.

Most
online
institutions
are
considered
diploma
factories
for
a
good
reason
because
frankly
they
don't
care
if
you
are
actually
learning
as
long
as
they
get
their
money
.

The
staff
is
nice
enough
but
there
doesn't
appear
to
be
much
of
a
process
for
quality
control
at
this
school
.

After
dealing
with
their
finance
dept
.

more
times
than
I'd
care
to
remember
spend
your
money
elsewhere
,
the
headache
isn't
worth
it
.

This
college
is
the
worst
thing
that
has
ever
happened
to
education
.

It
is
taking
advantage
of
the
poor
.

Poor
enter
the
school
with
hopes
of
earning
a
degree
to
get
them
better
jobs
and
pay
federal
monies
for
it
.

This
college
robs
them
of
the
chance
by
convincing
them
they
are
accomplishing
something
while
it
promotes
cheating
and
<_UNK>
.

These
people
have
to
pay
this
money
back
some
day
and
probably
won't
be
able
to
get
jobs
to
do
it
or
be
able
to
live
due
to
high
expense
of
paying
the
government
back
.

This
college
should
be
stopped
before
they
cause
bigger
debts
for
the
government
to
have
to
get
out
of
as
well
as
turning
out
uneducated
people
with
diplomas
that
mean
<_UNK>

I
am
a
MBA
student
with
0
classes
left
.

UOP
teachers
basically
grade
very
easy
and
there
are
no
tests
.

There
are
team
papers
for
about
0/0
of
the
assignments
and
most
of
the
students
I
worked
<_UNK>
wonder
how
they
graduated
from
high
school
.

Papers
are
supposed
to
be
written
in
APA
format
and
many
do
not
even
know
how
to
properly
cite
a
reference
.

Basically
an
easy
"
A
"
and
every
class
.

It
is
a
total
joke
of
a
school
.

You
can
learn
(
teach
yourself
)
but
you
do
not
learn
much
from
the
students
.

Most
do
not
read
the
weekly
chapters
and
have
little
to
add
to
discussions
.

There
must
be
some
kind
of
incentive
for
the
teachers
to
give
As
.

I
took
accounting
and
was
lost
through
out
most
of
the
course
because
I
found
it
difficult
to
teach
it
to
myself
.

I
am
embarassed
I
go
to
UOP
,
but
I
came
this
far
,
I
am
going
to
finish
.

Good
thing
I
work
for
the
<_UNK>
take
a
degree
for
anywhere
.

Hello
.
.
.
First
,
I
am
a
Capella
PhD
student
who
is
about
done
!
!

My
dissertation
is
currently
in
the
committee
approval
and
is
about
to
be
turned
into
the
school
for
approval
!

The
dissertation
process
was
the
hardest
thing
that
I
have
ever
done
,
mentally
(
and
I
have
done
several
demanding
tasks
in
the
US
Army
)
.

It
wasn't
hard
from
the
"
Capella
sucks
"
<_UNK>
from
the
"
you
can't
just
walk
in
there
,
pay
your
money
,
and
get
your
degree
"
mindset
.

For
those
who
have
that
mindset
about
Capella
,
you
need
to
be
put
away
for
insanity
(
or
for
frivolous
motivations
)
.

Do
I
ever
feel
that
I
have
to
defend
my
degree
(
or
soon
to
be
degree
)
?

Sure
.

Why
?

Because
all
of
the
nut
jobs
out
that
that
have
zero
clue
what
distance
education
is
about
and
their
failures
on
life
in
general
.

I
,
like
I
said
,
am
a
veteran
.

Mom
and
dad
couldn't
pony
up
for
me
to
go
off
to
school
right
out
of
HS
(
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
that
just
making
a
point
)
.

When
I
got
out
of
the
Army
,
I
had
started
a
family
and
a
career
,
so
the
act
of
going
to
school
(
even
part
time
)
was
hard
.

But
I
did
it
with
my
BS
and
MS
.

Something
that
I
have
learned
about
these
people
with
pessimism
towards
Capella
is
that
they
are
on
tilt
,
have
had
their
"
<_UNK>
"
feelings
hurt
by
the
process
,
or
just
are
down
right
<_UNK>
jealous
that
there
are
other
options
than
the
traditional
B
and
M
route
(
of
which
my
BS
and
MS
are
from
B
and
M
schools
)
.

With
all
that
praise
said
,
and
to
show
my
<_UNK>
towards
Capella
,
I
will
state
that
I
feel
they
over
advertise
on
mediums
such
as
the
Internet
,
which
brings
down
the
"
shine
"
in
a
sense
.

Also
,
they
do
need
to
start
putting
forth
some
more
stringent
standards
on
<_UNK>
scores
,
etc
.

AND
of
course
the
<_UNK>
<_UNK>
cheap
!

Just
<_UNK>
.

<_UNK>
<_UNK>
the
"
Einstein
"
that
made
the
idiotic
remark
that
people
that
<_UNK>
graduate
from
Capella
have
no
real
world
experience
.
.
.

Dude
,
get
a
clue
!

I
have
active
duty
military
experience
,
collegiate
teaching
experience
,
and
over
00
years
of
professional
IT
experience
.

You
can
take
your
foot
out
of
your
mouth
at
any
time
:
)

Well
after
reading
most
of
the
comments
here
,
I
will
say
that
I
am
even
more
afraid
to
start
"
UOP
"
as
everyone
here
is
calling
it
.

I
don't
have
any
<_UNK>
just
a
high
school
diploma
but
have
been
fortunate
enough
<_UNK>
my
work
years
to
have
really
great
jobs
with
high
incomes
and
still
have
one
of
those
jobs
today
.

But
for
my
own
personal
<_UNK>
I
really
want
to
go
back
to
school
and
receive
a
degree
.

I've
been
speaking
with
this
one
counselor
for
several
<_UNK>
now
from
UOP
and
he
calls
me
once
or
twice
a
week
to
know
if
I
am
still
going
to
enroll
in
the
classes
for
"
Associate
of
Arts
in
Business
"
?

I
tell
him
yes
but
inside
I
am
saying
?
?
?
?
?
?
because
I
have
been
burned
before
by
a
so
called
"
training
school
"
that
made
several
promises
for
the
job
market
today
in
the
Medical
Field
with
hard
work
and
your
<_UNK>
.

But
I
got
nothing
in
the
end
,
but
smart
mouth
<_UNK>
,
a
letter
to
pay
for
my
own
Graduation
and
a
bill
to
receive
my
Diploma
.

Thank
God
I
got
I
already
had
a
great
job
at
Kaiser
Permanente
Medical
Facility
,
because
without
my
own
great
<_UNK>
,
common
sense
,
self
motivation
and
hard
work
,
I
<_UNK>
if
that
school
would
have
helped
me
and
I
just
don't
want
to
go
through
it
again
.

Don't
get
me
wrong
,
I
know
that
some
things
and
places
are
what
you
make
it
but
If
I
am
paying
for
it
,
I
want
it
to
pay
off
,
and
not
just
get
the
money
and
run
.

Quick
story
in
regards
to
the
school
I
went
to
for
that
Medical
Diploma
,
while
on
my
job
at
the
Hospital
,
I
decided
to
tell
the
school
that
I
needed
them
to
fax
over
my
resume
for
a
position
at
the
Hospital
without
letting
them
know
I
already
worked
there
.

Because
this
was
one
of
the
schools
requirements
to
help
the
students
find
medical
positions
,
well
can
you
believe
that
the
school
faxed
over
00
resumes
of
other
students
and
not
one
was
mine
.

Can
you
believe
that
?

and
I
still
owe
Citibank
student
loans
today
.

Now
who
wants
to
get
burned
again
?
?

I
am
working
with
an
advisor
for
CTU
and
she
is
really
friendly
and
non
pushy
.

I
also
had
problems
accessing
one
of
the
webpages
Friday
night
after
<_UNK>
an
she
connected
me
to
technical
support
to
<_UNK>
the
issue
.

I
just
sent
them
<_UNK>
request
forms
.

I
will
wait
and
see
what
classes
they
accept
and
if
not
enough
i
will
not
sign
up
for
classes
but
so
far
I
have
had
a
very
positive
experience
.

I
find
it
hard
to
believe
all
the
negative
issues
with
the
advisors
.

I
had
a
0.00
GPA
and
other
options
.

Why
the
negative
vibe
by
some
?

I
have
read
all
of
you
<_UNK>
previous
post
and
I
can't
ascertain
so
many
negative
responses
.

I
just
completed
my
first
graduate
class
-
MGMT
000
(
The
Manager
in
a
Technological
Society
)
,
instructed
by
Dr
.
George
Ellis
and
TA
,
Dr
.
Patricia
McKenna
.

This
course
was
challenging
,
up-to-date
,
and
the
text
by
Daft
and
Mann
complimented
the
course
brilliantly
.

I
worked
very
intensely
for
the
A
I
received
.

Dr
.
Ellis
gave
wonderful
replies
and
critiques
to
assignments
that
were
submitted
in
reference
to
the
assigned
work
.

My
chosen
discipline
and
objective
is
a
<_UNK>
.
in
Human
Resource
<_UNK>
.

I
really
learned
a
plethora
of
strategies
,
structures
,
and
approaches
businesses
,
non-profit
,
and
public
sectors
use
,
which
fostered
a
better
understanding
of
the
way
corporations
operate
.

Perhaps
,
you
disgruntled
students
are
missing
the
point
all
together
.

Look
at
it
this
way
,
if
a
University
such
as
UMUC
did
not
admit
certain
people
,
would
a
chance
be
given
to
them
otherwise
?

I
look
at
it
like
this
,
as
long
as
the
college
is
accredited
,
I
could
care
less
how
easy
it
is
because
I
can
sale
myself
in
the
interview
for
a
position
once
I
complete
my
chosen
degree
.

I
bet
you
all
don't
have
good
interview
skills
to
sale
yourself
.

So
,
you
have
to
rely
on
a
school
name
to
get
you
hired
,
what
a
shame
.

I
can
make
a
penny
seem
like
a
fortune
.

I
just
need
to
attain
a
master's
to
open
doors
that
would
have
otherwise
been
closed
,
an
accredited
degree
which
UMUC
offers
,
will
work
just
fine
.

UMUC
has
a
pretty
good
reputation
from
other
post
I
have
read
.

There
are
mixed
reviews
from
students
that
have
attended
UMUC
.

All
I
know
is
,
the
first
class
I
took
I
liked
and
want
to
continue
at
UMUC
because
the
quality
of
my
degree
discipline
has
been
good
and
proven
commendable
so
far
.

Let
me
ask
you
all
this
,
If
UMUC
was
"
too
easy
"
and
the
students
and
staff
were
beneath
your
abilities
,
why
didn't
you
transfer
real
quick
?

Do
you
all
know
something
I
don't
?

When
people
attain
a
degree
from
UMUC
can
they
not
get
a
career
?

That's
all
I
need
to
know
.

If
<_UNK>
can't
find
work
by
obtaining
a
degree
at
UMUC
,
I
am
definitely
in
the
wrong
place
,
other
than
that
<_UNK>
straight
.

Reply
please
,
let
me
know
if
folks
don't
advance
or
find
jobs
upon
attaining
a
UMUC
degree
.

I
am
in
Technical
<_UNK>
at
DuPage
campus
;
Illinois
<_UNK>
matter
what
you
say
Devry
is
a
great
school
.

Yes
it
is
expensive
,
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
.
.
.

I
highly
recommend
DeVry
!
!
!

Great
school
,
excellent
and
thought
provoking
environment
.

Courses
are
rigorous
and
challenging
.

I
assume
your
<_UNK>
is
to
make
money
in
a
field
that
interests
you
.

Perceptions
count
;
you
must
have
something
an
employer
wants
,
and
he
must
know
he
wants
it
.

If
you
want
to
make
money
and
be
accepted
among
your
peers
,
your
should
be
to
graduate
from
a
school
with
a
football
team
rather
than
an
unheard
of
school
like
the
<_UNK>
of
this
world
.

Public
institutions
get
free
advertising
almost
every
night
on
the
local
<_UNK>
casts
.

So
you
get
built
in
name
recognition
of
your
school
.

Employers
in
your
state
are
more
likely
to
support
(
help
fund
)
the
public
institutions
of
your
state
because
they
serve
as
incubators
for
the
next
generation
of
their
employees
.

Their
managers
are
more
likely
to
be
Alums
of
a
Public
Institutions
(
get
the
good
old
boy
network
on
your
side
)
If
you
are
a
High
school
student
work
hard
to
make
yourself
eligible
for
your
states
public
university
or
college
.

If
you
are
a
recent
graduate
and
cant
get
into
a
public
college
go
to
your
local
community
college
.

My
bet
is
that
an
associates
degree
from
a
community
college
is
just
as
marketable
as
an
associates
degree
from
a
private
specialty
school
.

(
<_UNK>
I
mention
that
it
is
less
expensive
too
?
)
Some
(
dare
I
say
most
?
)
community
colleges
have
extension
classes
that
allow
you
to
gain
transferable
credits
to
a
state
0
year
institution
.

Lastly
if
none
of
these
options
meet
your
needs
(
I
think
you
should
re-evaluate
your
needs
but
!
)
by
all
means
check
out
a
private
school
such
as
<_UNK>
.

What
makes
my
opinion
any
better
or
worse
than
those
others
posted
on
this
site
?

Well
,
lets
see
I
am
a
00
,
<_UNK>
graduate
of
the
Phoenix
,
AZ
.
USA
,
<_UNK>
curriculum
.

I
am
also
a
Retired
Naval
officer
worked
in
the
electronics
field
for
00
years
now
as
a
technician
.

As
an
officer
I
have
had
some
management
experience
and
have
associated
with
other
managers
so
I
understand
how
they
think
.

Much
is
made
of
<_UNK>
,
mainly
by
<_UNK>
,
heavily
hands-on
focus
.

As
a
manager
hiring
an
engineer
,
I
would
be
more
interested
in
depth
of
knowledge
and
understanding
of
the
principles
of
engineering
and
science
,
and
the
ability
to
bring
those
principles
to
bear
on
problem
solving
rather
than
the
ability
to
actually
build
the
device
.

I
have
others
,
usually
titled
Technicians
,
to
which
I
assign
the
duties
of
fabrication
and
testing
.

Lastly
:
I
<_UNK>
looked
at
<_UNK>
curriculum
in
years
.

I
found
it
to
be
pretty
easy
.

It
was
thorough
but
it
didnt
tax
my
military
electronics
training
too
much
.

That
may
be
because
a
<_UNK>
degree
is
not
an
engineering
degree
.

It
is
a
Technician
Degree
.

BS
<_UNK>
generally
serve
as
engineering
technicians
not
engineers
.

That
is
left
to
those
who
have
years
of
experience
and
or
those
with
a
minimum
of
a
<_UNK>
degree
.

I
can
not
say
that
I
have
experienced
the
issues
outlined
by
<_UNK>
.

Connectivity
has
not
been
an
issue
.

University
of
<_UNK>
Online
has
provided
a
reliable
classroom
environment
.

The
material
is
challenging
and
learning
environment
is
unique
.

I
am
pleased
with
my
overall
experience
with
UOP
.
<_UNK>
To
<_UNK>
:
I
am
entering
my
final
class
for
my
Master
of
Science
in
Computer
Information
Systems
with
UOP
.

The
experience
has
been
a
positive
one
.

The
environment
is
certainly
different
from
an
actual
classroom
in
that
most
,
if
not
all
,
communication
is
conducted
online
.

Many
will
argue
that
you
miss
out
on
the
social
interaction
.

I
say
that
by
the
time
you
reach
college
,
your
social
skills
should
already
be
developed
and
the
focus
should
be
on
training
you
can
actually
use
.

In
this
day
and
age
computer
skills
and
the
ability
to
communicate
using
the
technology
available
is
a
necessity
in
the
corporate
world
.

UOP
provides
a
solid
education
and
forces
students
to
develop
a
sound
understanding
of
computer
technologies
.

I
am
a
firm
believer
in
UOP
and
online
learning
.

Dont
be
fooled
by
what
others
may
claim
.

Online
learning
is
not
a
cakewalk
.

It
takes
<_UNK>
and
focus
to
stay
on
course
but
the
results
are
extremely
rewarding
.

I
have
been
attending
UOP
for
nearly
two
years
,
things
apparently
came
to
an
end
because
the
inability
to
handle
issues
in
a
timely
manner
.

My
financial
counselor
is
a
liar
and
her
manager
is
a
coward
.

Over
time
I
have
been
experiencing
issues
with
many
of
the
faculty
,
their
feedback
(
individual
)
came
during
the
last
week
of
class
,
they
were
unresponsive
or
they
didnt
know
the
material
.

I
honestly
have
to
say
that
UOP
is
in
it
for
the
money
rather
than
the
success
of
their
students
.

I
am
considering
a
<_UNK>
in
criminal
justice
at
Capella
.

I
live
in
Georgia
and
currently
,
there
is
no
PhD
program
for
<_UNK>
in
the
state
.

I
am
in
law
enforcement
and
work
<_UNK>
,
so
the
flexibility
appeals
greatly
.

I
do
have
my
B.S
.
and
my
<_UNK>
.
from
brick
and
mortar
schools
.

I
am
also
looking
at
a
PhD
at
a
brick
and
mortar
,
but
it
is
not
in
criminal
justice
;
I
would
only
have
a
cognate
in
criminal
justice
.

I
would
like
to
teach
eventually
,
and
I
am
not
picky
as
to
whether
it
is
a
two
year
college
or
a
well
known
brick
and
mortar
.

Any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
,
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
.

UoP
sucks
!
!
!
!
!

They
get
your
money
and
then
screw
you
out
of
a
real
education
.

She
would
not
return
phone
calls
or
emails
.

This
college
lacks
too
much
to
risk
your
hard
earned
<_UNK>
another
college
and
seriously
research
them
before
joining
!
!
To
<_UNK>
:
I
made
straight
A's
at
UoP
.
.
<_UNK>
biggest
problem
is
they
are
too
big
,
hire
instructors
with
full
plates
already
to
instruct
,
and
lack
financial
aide
that
helps
with
book
costs
.

Their
program
for
financial
aide
is
screwed
up
!
!
!
AND
I
bet
since
you
work
at
a
<_UNK>
get
employer
repayment
or
at
least
half
your
<_UNK>
paid
.

A
lot
of
people
who
haven't
had
the
problems
<_UNK>
of
us
have
<_UNK>
were
not
fitting
the
entire
bill
therefore
had
no
worries
.

But
US
who
pay
and
work
hard
to
get
an
education
do
find
we
expect
<_UNK>
from
a
college
whether
online
or
not
.

I
took
on
UoP
knowing
full
well
the
work
load
would
be
heavy
,
but
it
was
going
to
be
well
worth
it
for
accomplishing
my
goals
.

So
please
do
not
say
I
or
others
did
not
have
the
abilities
to
complete
our
education
.

To
<_UNK>
:
I
do
agree
with
you
.
.
UoP
only
sees
potential
students
as
<_UNK>
and
their
programs
stink
!
!
Force
you
to
take
classes
that
do
not
need
to
be
taken
for
you
field
.

The
University
of
Phoenix
online
is
a
joke
.

Returning
students
who
need
an
online
program
should
do
everything
in
their
power
to
find
a
different
school
.

Standards
between
"
facilitators
"
(
they
don't
like
to
call
them
instructors
or
professors
at
UOP
)
are
practically
non-existent
.

The
"
Learning
Team
"
element
(
which
is
intrinsic
to
every
class
and
accounts
for
<_UNK>
of
your
grade
)
is
nothing
by
a
crapshoot
.

If
you
are
a
good
student
,
you
will
usually
(
not
always
,
but
usually
)
doing
<_UNK>
of
the
"
team
"
assignments
yourself
if
care
about
getting
an
A
in
the
class
.

Bottom
line
:
there
are
a
lot
of
online
degree
programs
available
now
<_UNK>
don't
waste
you
time
and
money
with
UOP
.

And
,
<_UNK>
,
just
in
case
you
think
this
is
a
"
sour
grapes
"
rant
<_UNK>
I'm
less
than
a
year
away
from
my
degree
and
still
have
a
0.0
GPA
.

I
wish
I'd
never
started
the
program
.

I
especially
saw
a
difference
when
I
had
to
go
looking
for
a
new
job
in
the
past
month
.

Had
an
offer
for
<_UNK>
more
than
I
made
in
my
last
job
.

On
a
two
year
sabbatical
,
I
had
to
pay
back
my
loan
from
Devry
.

The
financial
aid
person
was
excellent
and
by
far
the
best
credit
person
I've
ever
dealt
with
.

I
would
do
it
over
in
a
heartbeat
.

As
a
matter
of
fact
,
I'm
currently
attending
Keller
in
<_UNK>
for
my
<_UNK>
and
have
been
impressed
.

It
is
amazing
the
comments
about
a
<_UNK>
.

I
could
go
to
a
local
college
and
get
a
poor
education
also
just
from
a
lack
of
effort
.

That
would
seem
to
fit
any
of
these
people
.

You
only
get
out
what
you
put
in
.

I
am
curious
though
,
how
many
of
you
folks
that
got
out
of
this
college
went
on
to
another
college
and
got
your
degree
?

anyone
?

Yep
,
sure
is
easy
to
complain
though
.

Sure
you
do
.
.
.
.
.

Try
this
,
enroll
in
a
brick
and
mortar
,
get
your
degree
and
then
come
back
and
tell
me
what
a
lousy
school
it
is
because
at
least
I
know
you
tried
to
better
yourself
.

Why
,
because
I
spend
the
time
to
learn
and
not
get
<_UNK>
like
some
of
my
buddies
who
went
to
brick
and
mortar
schools
.

<_UNK>
fun
with
your
life
I
am
sure
you
will
find
plenty
to
bitch
about
as
time
passes
you
<_UNK>
any
degrees
!

Thank
you
for
your
attention
.

Student
of
<_UNK>
.

I
recieved
my
Bachelors
in
Software
Engineering
last
fall
.

I
graduated
with
a
0.00
GPA
.

I
don't
feel
I
really
learned
all
that
much
as
every
assignment
I
did
was
done
with
info
off
the
net
and
I
probably
only
listened
to
half
a
dozen
chats
.

Chats
tended
to
be
worthless
drivel
of
some
instructor
simply
reading
out
of
a
book
or
off
slides
.

I've
had
to
go
back
and
use
the
books
I
was
sent
and
complete
the
projects
in
them
on
my
own
time
to
truly
feel
that
I
earned
the
degree
on
my
wall
.

Its
an
easy
A
no
matter
what
you
are
told
,
but
if
you
really
put
effort
into
it
you
can
learn
.

It's
just
sad
that
you
can't
get
the
degree
for
a
whole
lot
less
money
.

For
the
sake
of
time
-
I
will
not
comment
on
quality
of
education
-
<_UNK>
assume
it
is
OK
compared
to
it's
competitors
.

The
school
never
admits
fault
-
<_UNK>
its
frequent
<_UNK>
.

Considering
it
has
a
business
school
-
it
is
one
of
the
most
poorly
run
business
I
have
ever
been
associated
with
.

I
would
not
recommend
Capella
to
ANYONE
.

There
are
better
institutions
out
there
.

What
is
UMUC's
point
in
Europe
?

Some
posts
have
no
courses
marked
<_UNK>
.

<_UNK>
,
what
is
the
point
of
a
UMUC
brochure
listing
courses
,
when
they
don't
offer
many
new
courses
,
or
only
a
fraction
of
those
listed
in
the
brochure
.

It's
the
same
courses
,
and
the
same
professors
adding
little
new
to
what
they
said
last
year
,
or
the
year
before
.

It's
the
same
planners
in
Heidelberg
too
.

They
say
if
you
don't
like
what
they
offer
go
to
DE
.
That's
not
a
helpful
solution
.

Nothing
against
DE
for
<_UNK>
who
want
it
,
but
I'd
like
a
classroom
learning
experience
.

I
think
both
Army
and
Air
Force
folks
here
in
Europe
want
better
from
the
planners
in
Heidelberg
(
who
probably
should
retire
to
make
<_UNK>
more
innovative
management
)
.

That's
what
people
say
here
,
and
even
the
local
ESO
agrees
.

Get
with
it
UMUC
.

You
make
a
lot
of
money
off
of
us
,
so
start
giving
back
some
quality
.

And
,
by
the
way
,
the
Army
needs
to
get
over
the
<_UNK>
thing
.

Like
UMUC
,
<_UNK>
too
seems
like
such
a
scam
.

I
am
currently
going
to
DeVry
.

I
went
to
a
state
college
like
some
of
the
posters
said
is
better
this
was
in
FL
.

I
left
the
school
0
semester
away
from
my
<_UNK>
degree
because
the
education
was
so
horrible
.

I
already
knew
most
of
the
stuff
before
the
classes
began
,
most
classes
I
did
not
even
have
to
open
the
book
and
I
got
an
A
.
I
left
there
with
a
0.00
GPA
.

Besides
some
pain
in
the
butt
financial
aid
issues
that
were
resolved
my
education
at
DeVry
has
been
great
.

I
was
really
worried
about
going
there
because
of
how
much
bashing
the
school
takes
.

The
classes
I
have
taken
are
actually
challenging
,
the
teachers
know
a
lot
more
than
the
teachers
at
my
previous
college
.

I
know
someone
posted
something
about
throwing
out
applications
that
have
a
school
where
you
only
go
0
years
for
a
Bachelors
degree
.

I'm
not
sure
where
this
person
was
so
seriously
misinformed
,
but
going
full
time
it
takes
0
0/0
years
,
so
that
is
a
whole
0
months
less
than
a
traditional
college
.

We
do
have
0
week
terms
instead
of
00
weeks
,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
we
do
less
work
.

It
is
the
same
amount
of
work
just
a
shorter
time
frame
.

I
learn
more
in
an
0
week
class
at
DeVry
than
probably
my
whole
wasted
education
at
my
previous
college
.

<_UNK>
they
the
greatest
college
out
there
?

Of
course
not
.

I
go
online
so
I
cannot
say
about
any
of
the
locations
.

So
do
not
believe
that
the
traditional
college
is
so
much
better
and
DeVry
is
a
scam
.

I
have
went
to
a
traditional
college
and
friends
that
went
to
them
and
what
I
have
learned
at
DeVry
is
much
more
advanced
than
any
of
those
other
colleges
.

Again
it
is
not
the
best
school
,
but
neither
are
all
of
the
traditional
colleges
,
and
the
ones
that
are
really
good
are
also
hard
to
get
into
.

I
was
suckered
by
a
traditional
college
that
did
nothing
to
prepare
me
for
the
field
I
was
studying
;
DeVry
on
the
other
hand
is
actually
preparing
me
for
my
intended
field
as
well
as
educating
me
on
other
aspects
meaning
there
is
more
than
one
field
I
could
go
into
.

It
is
kind
of
overpriced
,
but
it's
still
a
great
education
and
it
cost
only
a
little
more
than
the
traditional
college
that
I
wasted
almost
0
years
of
my
life
at
.

So
yeah
traditional
colleges
look
great
on
paper
,
just
don't
expect
to
learn
too
much
.
